# SimpleTasks

PROJECT PURPOSE:
To create a minimal distraction TODO prototype. The main focus of this program is to present TODO tasks one at a time instead at once.
This is also just a project for me to demostrate basic React capabilities

HOW-TO-USE:
At the moment this is just a simple webapp, the repo is public for those who wish to inspect my code.
I will host a website soon for demostrative purposes.

PLANNED FEATURES:
Ability to request a task from tasklist
Toggle completed tasks count
Toggle tasks count left
Ability to prioritize new tasks by due date
Ability to add priority tags to tasks

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
React.js
Bootstrap
Supabase
